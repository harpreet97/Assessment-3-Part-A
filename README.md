**What frameworks did you look into and why?**

There are many framework used in the web development and here are the name of some of them - 
* BootStrap
* Google Material

* Foundation

It is very important to select a proper framework that will be suitable for the website and i have selected these two from all the other frameworks -

## **1. Google Material Design -** 

Material Design Lite is an designing language invented by the talented group of Google officials. It is a advance designing platform which empowers you to include material outline look and feel to your proposed sites. With this platform, you will discover numerous components that are incorporated into the Material Design library to create information driven and profoundly intelligent applications and sites. To be particular, it can be expressed that this platform does not depend on any JavaScript structures and dependably advances web architecture improvement on multi-browser compatibility. It is extraordinary compared to other piece of it is that it is a bundle of Vanilla JavaScript and CSS which never point towards conditions and make it wonderful for site development.

## **2. Bootstrap -**

It is presented by Twitter, Bootstrap is a Java, HTML and CSS structure appreciated for planning the front-end sites and web applications. It is a free open source web system which supports less demanding and speedier web improvement. It utilizes CSS and HTML based layouts in order to design with typography, buttons, forms and navigation. It is additionally open for supporting optional JavaScript extensions. Also, Bootstrap gives you the facility to fabricate responsive formats by using less efforts. It almost all built-in HTML elements are styled and can fit nicely together in a layout. It gives you a great number of additional components for any type of design. There are heaps of contents available online which are easy to use. Bootstrap has a very detailed documentation sn,and development involves copy pasting from the examples and getting a usable result fast.

**What one are using for your final design?**

I will use bootstrap for my wesite project beacuse it helps to save coding effort by offering less CSS functionality and pre-built blocks of code rather than structuring code from the scratch. I have also looked at other frameworks but I find bootstarp useful that it has various amount of responsive designs that could help me in making my website. Moreover, its a Css framework with predefined classes for layout using its grid system. In Bootstrap, almost all built-in HTML elements are styled and can fit nicely together in a layout. It gives you a great number of additional components for any type of design whereas in Google Material Design you will get fewer components than Bootstrap but they are all focused on building modern Material Design applications. Bootstrap has been around for quite some time and has an enormous community which produces themes, plugins and blog posts whereas Material Design Lite recently came out and doesn't have much resources. Additionally, Bootstrap has an advanced grid system with offsets, column wrapping, hiding and reordering of columns while MDL has a more primitive grid that gets the job done most of the time, but doesn't support advanced features. As my website have a navbar on the left side so i can pick and choose that type of features that i need for my website coz Bootstrap has all the components which i need for making the website like the templates that i looked into online. I can find anything beacuse everything is easily available.
